```assembly
mov eax, [ebx + 0x10]
add eax, ecx
mov [ebx + 0x14], eax
```
This code snippet has a potential error related to memory alignment and access. If the variable at `[ebx + 0x10]` is not properly aligned to the size of `eax` (which is typically 32 bits or 4 bytes), then this could lead to an alignment fault or exception.  The same applies for writing back the result to `[ebx + 0x14]`.
